| Sep 24 |  1:50-2:20pm  | I recalled the concept of a dictionary (hashmap) in python and looked through the java docs. This led me to find the hashtable class and implement it in my code. This solution passed all tests, but I would like to implement a hashtable on my own. Sorry for not commiting this at the correct time. I hadn't finished writing it last class and didn't want to work through Kieran's presentation |
| Sep 29 | 10:30-11:00pm |                                                       I decided to switch to a tree based approach after talking with friends in class. I designed a tree where each node would represent a letter and nodes would be strung together to create words. Once the end of a word was reached, the tree would mark it with a boolean. I started implementing this approach, but I still have one bug left. |
| Sep 30 |   8-8:30am    |                                                                                                                      I spent this 30 minute period debugging my code. I figured out that I was not handling duplicates, so I treated each mispelled word as a newly valid word so that it won't be counted twice. I pass one more test, but am not handling another edge case and so I fail two tests. |
