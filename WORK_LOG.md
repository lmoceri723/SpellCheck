| Sep 24 |  1:50-2:20pm  | I recalled the concept of a dictionary (hashmap) in python and looked through the java docs. This led me to find the hashtable class and implement it in my code. This solution passed all tests, but I would like to implement a hashtable on my own. Sorry for not commiting this at the correct time. I hadn't finished writing it last class and didn't want to work through Kieran's presentation |

I designed a tree where each node would represent a letter and nodes would be strung together to create words. Once the end of a word was reached, the tree would mark it with a boolean. I started implementing this approach, but I still have one bug left. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
